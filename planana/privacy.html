                        <li><strong>Local Data Storage:</strong> All user-inputted data (including text, images, links, and time) is stored only on your device. We do not store any personal information on our servers.</li>

                    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
                    <p>Our app integrates with third-party services for performance analysis. These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them to understand how your data is handled.</p>
                
                    <h3>4.1 Services Used for Performance Analytics</h3>
                
                    <h4>4.1.1 Google Analytics (Firebase)</h4>
                    <p>We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymized usage data that helps us understand how users interact with the app and improve its performance. Firebase collects data such as device information, usage patterns, and user interactions. For more details, please review <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy and Security</a>.</p>
                
                    <h4>4.1.2 External Analysis Tools</h4>
                    <p>We may use other third-party services to improve the app’s performance and user experience. These tools collect only anonymized usage data and do not access your personal data or the data stored on your device.</p>
                
                    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>

                    <p>Please note that analytics data is collected anonymously and cannot be linked to individual users. As such, we cannot provide access to or delete specific user analytics data, as this information is aggregated and non-identifiable.</p>
                
                    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
